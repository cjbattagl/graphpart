\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}
In this work, we demonstrated \ourmethod, a \emph{distributed, streaming} partitioner.
\ourmethod uses an efficient distributed, sparse representation of the graph to perform fast, scalable partitioning.
We demonstrated \ourmethod on real-world and synthetic graphs by analyzing both (1) partition quality and (2) implementation scalability.
\ourmethod is scalable and can partition a graph of \largestgraphedges edges in \largestgraphtime, while maintaining partition quality comparable with the competitors.
\ourmethod will allow researchers and analysts to generate partitions for their work faster and easier than before.
