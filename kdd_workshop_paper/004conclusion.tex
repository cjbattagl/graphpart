\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}
In this work, we demonstrated \ourmethod, a \emph{distributed, streaming} partitioner. 

While Power-Law graphs are considered to be very difficult to partition~\cite{Abou-Rjeili:2006:MAP:1898953.1899055}, we have demonstrated that a very simple, fast algorithm is capable of significantly reducing communication in their parallel computation. Using the methodology outlined by Nishimura and Ugander~\cite{nishimura2013restream} and applying an HPC framework we have scaled the partitioning process to graphs with billions of nodes in a matter of seconds, while more sophisticated graph partitioners struggle on graphs that are orders of magnitude smaller.

We have demonstrated our implementation on both real world and high-scale synthetic graphs on a leading supercomputer. \ourmethod is scalable and can partition a graph of \largestgraphedges edges in \largestgraphtime, while maintaining partition quality comparable to what competing implementations achieve on smaller-scale graphs.
