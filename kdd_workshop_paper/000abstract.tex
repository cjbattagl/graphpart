Modern graph data have grown beyond the memory limits of most single machines. 
Graph partitioning is the process of dividing a graph into subgraphs such that the number of edges between subgraphs is reduced. 
In this work we investigate the process of partitioning a graph using a \emph{distributed, streaming} partitioner, which must make partition decisions as each vertex is read from memory, simulating an online algorithm that must process nodes as they arrive. 
We demonstrate and analyze streaming graph partitioning on a wide spectrum of real-world and synthetic graphs, as well as explore ways of improving partition quality.
