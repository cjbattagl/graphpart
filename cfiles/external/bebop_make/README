The bebop_make project is a collection of Makefile options for
building various Berkeley Benchmarking and Optimization Group (BeBOP)
projects.  For more details on BeBOP, see

http://bebop.cs.berkeley.edu

Build instructions:

1. Unpack the bebop_make project.  (You must have done that already,
   else how could you be reading this README?)

2. Look at the "options" file to make sure that the
   platform-independent build options are set as desired.  In most
   cases, you won't have to edit this file.  If you do have to edit
   it, the options are documented in the file itself.

3. Create a platform-specific build file: if your platform is
   <platform> (e.g., linux, darwin) and a Makefile.include.<platform>
   is provided, use that file as a template.  Often you won't have to
   edit this file.  If no such file is provided for your platform, use
   one of the Makefile.include.<platform> files as a template to make
   your own.

4. Create a symlink from your Makefile.include.<platform> file to
   Makefile.include in this directory.  If the latter exists as a file
   or symlink, just overwrite it.

5. If you are using ECL (see the "options" file), edit the "ecl" file
   in this directory and check the paths of the ecl and ecl-config
   executables.  Change them if necessary.  The system is set up NOT
   to use ECL by default, so you don't have to change these unless you
   modify the "options" file and request to use ECL.
