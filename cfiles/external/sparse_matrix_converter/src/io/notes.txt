Should have a single routine, LAPACK - style, that's called once to get the
value type, and called again to get all the values.  The first call must save
the first line in a struct so as not to throw away the first value(s).

typedef struct __rsm_t {
  void* values;
  void* __I;
  void* __J;
  ...
} rsm_t;

We can optimistically set the index type to uint32_t, and then pop it up to
uint64_t if strtol() fails with errno == ERANGE.  Much better than writing our
own integer parser in C!  There's probably a "long long" version of strtol(); if
it fails with ERANGE, then we're stuck.  I don't want to standardize on a bignum
library...

int
read_sparse_matrix (rsm_t* matrix, FILE* f);
