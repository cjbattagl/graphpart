* Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix file format
** Held at 80 columns
*** Presumably this could be relaxed for higher-precision values, esp. for complex matrices
** Right-hand sides, starting guesses, and solution vectors
*** If no right-hand sides, then header block is four lines long, else five lines
*** For right-hand sides, must have numerical values in matrix (i.e., can't be a pattern matrix)
*** Right-hand sides
**** Can be full ('F') or sparse ('M' for same format as the matrix)
**** Sparse right-hand sides 
***** Only allowed for assembled matrix
***** Stored exactly as a standard sparse matrix
***** Same number of rows as the coefficient matrix
***** Same number of columns as NRHS (number of right-hand sides), obviously

*** Starting guesses and solution vectors
**** Can only be present when right-hand side(s) are present
**** Only full storage is allowed
*** Line 5 of header 
**** Only present if there are right-hand sides

| Column(s) | Purpose                                                           |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         1 | RHS type ('F' for full, 'M' for same format as matrix)            |
|         2 | 'G' if (a) starting vector(s) is/are supplied (RHSTYP)            |
|         3 | 'X' if an eXact solution vector(s) is/are supplied                |
|     15-28 | NRHS                                                              |
|     29-42 | NRHSIX - number of row indices (ignored for unassembled matrices) |
 
** Use RHSFMT as format for reading right-hand sides
*** RHSFMT is header line 4, cols 53:72
**** Text column index numbering starts at 1
