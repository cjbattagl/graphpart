ombinatorial BLAS compilation instructions for NERSC resources. 

1- First and foremost, make cmake active by running: module load cmake 
2- In your CombBLAS_xx directory, rename CMakeLists_NERSC.txt to CMakeLists.txt, replacing the existing one. 
3- (On Hopper only) Change the compiler to GNU, using the following command: module swap PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-gnu 

Now run "cmake ." , followed by "make" 



For tests, you might want to run them through the interactive batch system via 
> "qsub -I -V -q debug -l mppwidth=48" 
> "cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR" 
> "ctest -V"
